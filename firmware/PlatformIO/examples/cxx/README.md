# C++ Example Applications

The example applications here show that basic C++ features work in ESP-IDF. If you are looking for high-level C++ APIs, please take a look at [ESP-IDF-CXX](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-cxx). It has a range of C++ wrapper classes which aim to be easy-to-use, safe, provide automatic resource management and check more at compile time to avoid run time errors.
